> I'll never write these functions again.

JS SDK will, hopefully, solve the problem of writing all those helpers/utils functions again.

The goal is to provide a foundation where you can find all the functions you always end up writing over and over again.

It provide a collection of repositories with some useful functions which you can compose to make your task.

Benefits for supporting this initiative:

- Never write those functions again.

- Use well-know and tested functions.

- Remove the boulder of having to provide/write components with UI + Helpers/Utils.

- Improves composition.
